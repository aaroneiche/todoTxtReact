# todoTxtReact
---

todoTxtReact is (eventually going to be) a Chrome plugin that allows a user to access, and manipulate
a todoTxt todo list from within Chrome.

It is inspired in part by Aditya Bhaskar's [Todo.txt for Chrome](https://c306.net/apps/).

### Why are you making a Todo list?
Todo apps are the go to problem solver of many a 1st year developer. I've been developing for over a
decade and Occasionally dipped my toe into this problem. After having tried half-a-dozen GTDish task
systems, I've settled into the [TodoTxt format](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format). It's not perfect but it accomplishes much of what I need.
The Todo.txt for Chrome plugin go me most of the way there, but is not open source. I made some changes to
it and after a while decided that I needed to write something myself. On top of this, I've spent less time
than I'd like to in ReactJS so it gave me the opportunity to learn more stuff.

### Can I put it in Chrome right now?
You can try, it won't work because the project structure is incorrect for that.

### When will it be ready?
I don't know - I'm working on it as I have time. If you want to contribute, that would be really great!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
